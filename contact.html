		<p id="textinfo">My name is Luc Spescha. I am 16 years of Age an I'm from beautiful Flims, Switzerland. My favourite hobby is photography and all the things , that come with it. One of the things I enjoy most about this hobby is the post production. I think the creativity of a photographer is really shown by his editing style, but of course also the compositon and all that. Over the past few years I've been working on my preset pack called "Norwegien vibes". It contains about 15 presets, that work on almost every shot I take. They really help me, to keep my Instagram grid alive and to maintain a similar theme. </p>
